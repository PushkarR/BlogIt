# BlogIt
BlogIt is a blogging web application created using AngularJS and jQuery, and styled using basic Bootstrap.
It follows the single page application (SPA) structure.
This is the first project that I've created using Angular and this will be developed further as I learn more and gain more experience in Angular.
